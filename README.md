module 6, WeatherPy with Python API's
## Overview
This repository contains all of the work we learned in module 6, learning how to work with API's. We learned the basics of requests, JSON's, google maps markers, directions and heat maps.

The challenege was to generate 2000 random Latitude and Longitude pairs, then match them with the closest city, if available. Then we made an OpenWeatherMap API call to gather the individual weather data for each city, and retrieved a new category of data from the API (the current description of the weather, clear, partly cloudy and so on). We then wrote code to retrieve customer weather requirements, and used those preferences to filter our potential travel destinations and find the closest hotel. We then generated a map with a marker layer, that had the hotel information in pop-up markers. We then generated a travel itinerary that shows the route between 4 cities chosen from the customers possible travel destinations. In this case, a loop through the southern californian coast.
